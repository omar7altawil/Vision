Voice user interface system provide blind people with a full room description.
Our idea of the Vision System is to make a system that the visually impaired people can
use to overcome navigation problems that they might face in the case of them entering 
a new environment. Our idea was to focus on one aspect or in other words one of the
many challenges faced by the visually challenged people which is coming to be familiar
with a new environment or one that contains quite varying objects in terms of location.
So, we came up with our initial would provide the visually challenged person with a
brief description of the surrounding environment in no time. The visually challenged
person then would navigate inside that new environment depending on the description.
We further narrowed down our environment to a place that our target user frequently
visit or go to, such as his or her own house or a room within the house.
